A clone of the building planner by Dissi built using React.

It has a few features that the old planner didn't have:

 - Road and Ramparts are on thier own layers so you can plan structures inside ramparts.
 - Screeps API calls are now run though the Express App removing the depedency on the screeps web APIs

## Creep Designer

Allows you to build creeps and see the stats & avialable creep functions for that creep.

## Memory Viewer

View your memory from any shard and query it using jq.
